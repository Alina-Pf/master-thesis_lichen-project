# master-thesis_lichen-project
 A collection of scripts I created for my masters thesis.
# 
script: TE_blast_hits_on_kmer_PCA_automated.R
 Consists of two separate loops:
  1. Plots blast hits on PCA based on "short" kmer (min length = 10'000)
      + export of PCA tables
  2. Plots GC content on PCA based on "long" kmer (min length = 20'000) (with short kmers, GC content is "averaged"/no differenced)
